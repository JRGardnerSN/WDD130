The Cavern Of Thoughtful Idiots

*** When you think, can you hear to your own thoughts? Do they sound like your voice? Do they make an echo like in a cave or a cavern? ***

Mine kinda do from the sound of it. It's kinda fun to think out loud-- to share your thoughts, hopes, fears, and even a joke or two.
I want to share what I think about with you, and I have some friends who also want to share their thoughts with you.  
We're making a podcast, and I my goal is to make a website to host each episode and give people a chance to listen in.
The idea is to make easy to use. We want you to be able to interact with us too, leave comments if you like!
Here, we're going to think about anything and everything so we can grow in knowledge and wisdom.
Hope to see you in the cavern!
